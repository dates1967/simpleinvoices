==Gene Extensions==

===About===

This extension provides Purchase Order abilities in Simple Invoices to suit the requested workflow

===Main features===

Ability to adjust the the price and cost of a product during invoice creation/editing
some funky ajax to load the cost/price into editable input box per line item based on drop down list product selection
etc.. (Justin to write more stuff here)

===Status===

This extension is currently work in progress

===SQL===

There are modifications required to the Simple Invoices database for this extension to work

They are detailed in ./extensions/gene/install/sql.php

===Config===

You need to edit ./config/config.php and enable the gene extension, refer how_to_enable_an_extension for how to do this


===Simple Invoices settings===

====Invoice Preference====

Invoice preference with the ID of 5 (which by default is Quotes) to be edited to be the Purchase Order invoice preference

When you create a new Invoice it will default to Invoice Preference of ID = 1

When you create a new Purchase Order it will default to Invoice Preference of ID = 5

this is required so various pages display the correctly setting for POs and Invoices

====Products====

Edit the products in your database to include a Unit Cost, if you don;t when you create a new PO and select a product nothing will auto populate in the unit cost box

====Custom Fields====

====Invoices====

Edit Custom Fields and set the custom field 1 for Invoices to be Shipping. This stores the shiping cost in the si_invoices table against the invoice and is used to calc the loaded unit cost (si_invoice_items.unit_load_cost)

Edit Custom Fields and set the custom field 1 for Invoices to be PO Received.

====Customers====

Edit Custom Fields and set the custom field 1 for Customers to be 'Customer or Vendor'.

====General====

This is only available in the nextrelease branch in svn as at 25th March 2008

==Product Matrix Extension==

===About===

This extension provides a product matrix for Simple Invoices. This means that in invoice creation you can selcet a product and then a list of attributes and values will be display that are relavent to that product for you to choose from

ie. - Product = T-Shirt - Product Attributes = Size, Colour - Product Values = Size (Small, Medium, Large), Colour (Red, White, Blue)

In the Manage Product Values screen you can add new values and assign then to certain attributes, and in edit/add products you can assign attributes to a certain product

===Status===

This extension is currently work in progress

You can just import this .sql file into phpMyAdmin for the db changes to be applied

===Config===

You need to edit ./config/config.php and enable the product matrix extension, refer how_to_enable_an_extension for how to do this

===Simple Invoices settings===

====Product Attributes====

Product attributes are the group of values that a product can have ie for the product 'T-shirt' it may have product attributes of size and colour

====Product Values====

Product values is the assigning of multiple values to a product attribute ie for the product 'T-shirt' with product attributes of size it may have product values of Small, Medium, and Large

==Text UI Extension==

===About===

This extension makes it possible to use Simple Invoices on a small phone with internet browser - ie. HTC Touch - (ie. phones smaller tahn the iphone)

Manage pages rewritten to work on small screen

===Status===

This extension is currently work in progress

===Notes===

This extension has been designed to work with the product_matrix extension
This extension is designed to be used with 2 installs (1 with this extension enabled and 1 without)
this is so that all the setup and more specific config stuff can be done using the normal UI on a PC and the text_ui version just for the mobile version

===Config===

You need to edit ./config/config.php and enable the text_ui extension, refer how_to_enable_an_extension for how to do this

==Default Invoice Extension==

===About===

This extension allows you to create new invoices, based on an existing one.

===Details===

When this extension is enabled, the following happens:

In the Manage Customers, the last invoice of each customer is shown (in an extra column). In the Manage Customers page, the action 'Add invoice' is available.

When Add invoice is clicked, the new invoice (itemised style) is created as normal, but then prefilled with the contents of the template invoice. Recurring invoices are made easy, though still manual. The only items not from the template are the invoice date and the invoice number.

The invoice is added once the 'save' button is hit.

By default, the template invoice number is stored in custom userfield customer_cf4

=Modifications=

Modifications are unintegrated customisations to Simple Invoices

Note: it is preferable if you create an extension rather then a modification, modification where how we used to do stuff prior to the new Simple Invoices extensions system existing

This is the place to detail any add-on or modification your made to your own version of Simple Invoices that the rest of the Simple Invoices community can benefit from

----

==Custom Numbering==

When I saw invoice numbering i have on mind, this isnt good for my. But I have solution for users with <10000 invoices maybe more. open: include/sql_queries.php and paste this code on the end:
{{{
function lastInvoiceYearItem($type_id="2",$format="y",$inv_length="3") {
$year_newid = $type_id.date($format).sprintf("%0".$inv_length."d","0");
$sql = "SELECT count(`date`) AS count FROM `".TB_PREFIX."invoices` WHERE YEAR(`date`) = YEAR(CURDATE()) AND `type_id` = '".$type_id."'";
$lastinyear = dbQuery($sql);
$lastinyear_num = $lastinyear->fetch();
$year_id = $lastinyear_num["count"]+1;
$year_newid = $type_id.date($format).sprintf("%0".$inv_length."d",$year_id);
return $year_newid;
}
}}}
Go to line: 1914 and comment the line, next add this:
{{{
':index_id', lastInvoiceYearItem(), //':index_id',
index::next('invoice',$pref_group[index_group]),
after // is commented line
}}}
This is all, you can format your invoice numbering. But type ID its in this case only 2, bug is reported!

==Smart Invoice Numbering==

===Description===

I wanted to output my invoice numbers into this form: 000022, 000023, etc… I decided to do this with a Smarty plugin, so that I wouldn't have to change any of the core code, only my invoice templates.

===Installation===

Upload the PHP file function.invoice_number.php inside the plug-in folder: /simpleinvoices/include/smarty_plugins/ to enable the plugin for all Simple Invoices' template files (all templates inside /simpleinvoices/templates/default).

You're not ready yet. The invoice templates (/templates/invoices/) won't load the plug-in. So, you also need to upload the file function.invoice_number.php into this folder: /templates/invoices/{yourinvoicetemplate}/plugins/.

Now the plug-in is automatically loaded and usable.

===Download===

You can download the zip file [http://www.gelderblomwebdesign.nl/public/simpleinvoices/smarty_invoice_number.zip here]. 
- or refer the below Code section

===Examples===

====Basic usage====

In most templates, the invoice number is printed with this code:
{{{
{$invoice.id}
}}}
Change it to this form:
{{{
{invoice_number invoiceId=$invoice.id}
}}}
This will invoke the Smarty function that adds the 0's, so that the invoice number is exactly 0 characters long, eg: 000022.

====Specify the length====

If you want to specify the length of your invoice number (default is 6), you can easily change this. Just add the parameter length=8, or any other length, to the smarty code. For example:
{{{
{invoiceNumber invoiceId=$invoice.id length=8}
}}}

===Author and copyright===
