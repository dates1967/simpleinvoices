We have moved all the information regarding translation onto another [page](http://code.google.com/p/simpleinvoices/wiki/translate) in order to have all the relevant information at one place.


## Helping out on the forums ##
  * There is always some posts on the [forum](http://www.simpleinvoices.org/forum) that can be better answered. If you can help out answering/resolving someones issue its a great help and a great way to build a stronger community
  * Got some useful tips: Feel free to post any tips/updates/whatever in our forum or blog.


## Coding ##

  * Know or want to know PHP and or MySQL. Jump on the [developers forum on posterous](http://dev.simpleinvoices.org/) or check out our [todo list](http://code.google.com/p/simpleinvoices/wiki/todo) to see whats planned for future development. If you can lend a hand coding its always greatly appreciated. If you want to follow on what is happening you can register for our [tracker](http://tracker.simpleinvoices.org/) too. There you can see all commits.
  * Note: for those interested in Simple Invoices development I suggest a quick read the following link [37signals.com :: less features, small and passionate dev teams](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php)
  * Got an idea you want to code but its not on our list or forum. Go for it!!! Just because we have not thought about it or bugged it does not mean it should not get done. It would be good if you could write in the developers forum about it too. Maybe someone else already started the same thing but did not finish it till now.
  * Also we have a development mailing list at http://dev.simpleinvoices.org
  * if you want to chat to the developers we have a jabber/xmpp channel:
    * Room: simpleinvoices
    * Server: conference.jabber.org


## Donating ##

Simple Invoices has minimal expenses and those are covered by http://sixhq.com & http://smarterinvoices.com.  We used to have a paypal donate button - but was taken off as I would prefer to keep Simple Invoices.org as 'money-free' as possible.

If you do have money that you would like to donate the best options are to either buy some Google Ads or Reddit Ads or something similar to help spread the word
