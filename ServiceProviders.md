# Why a Market Place? #
Though the Simple Invoices [http://www.simpleinvoices.org/forum|Forums] rock and provide the level of support that most people will need, it became clear that some members of the Simple Invoices community required a level of support that was not practical under the normal open source/community model

What also became evident was a need to provide a clear path for development of extensions or modifications and other services for Simple Invoices for specific people on a for $ basis

The main aim of the Market Place is to create an ecosystem around Simple Invoices where for $ work can be done without interfering with the natural open-source development and support of Simple Invoices

For more on why the Market Place was started refer: http://www.sixhq.com/#why
